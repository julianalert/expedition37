You want to hold your partner's hand without glances, meet new friends without second-guessing, and just soak in the sun without any worry."

Lesbian-friendly beaches, however, tend to be less obvious. Often they're smaller sections within larger LGBTQ+ spots, tucked away but buzzing with the same warmth and sense of community. And when you find them, you discover more than a stretch of sand. You find belonging."

Near the parking lot, you'll see families. Keep walking and you'll find the lesbian section, then the gay male area, and finally the nude stretch."
