      content: "<strong>Halal Food Availability:</strong> This is non-negotiable, right? You're going to need to eat, and scrambling to find halal options or surviving on french fries for a week isn't exactly romantic. The best halal honeymoon destinations either have thriving Muslim populations (which means plenty of halal restaurants) or cater specifically to Muslim tourists with certified halal dining options."

      type: 'paragraph',

Nobody wants to deal with stares or unwanted attention during what should be a special time."

    {
      type: 'paragraph',
      content: "<strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Places where locals understand and respect Islamic practices make your honeymoon so much smoother.
